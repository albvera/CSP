In order to link the constrained highway dimension to hub labels, we first convert the original graph $G$ (with length and cost functions) into an \emph{augmented graph} $G^B$ with only edge lengths, such that the \emph{efficient paths of $G$ are in bijection with the shortest paths of $G^B$}.
We achieve this as follows: Each node in $G^B$ is of the form $\pp{v,b}$, which encodes the information of the remaining budget $b\geq 0$ and location $v\in V$.
A node is connected to neighbors (according to $E$) as long as the remaining budget of that transition is non-negative.
Finally, we create $n$ sink nodes, denoted $v^-$, and connect node $\pp{v,b}$ to $v^-$ with length $1/(b+1)$.
An illustration of the construction is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:augmented}.
The following definition formalizes this. 

\begin{definition}[Augmented Graph]
Given $(G,\ell,c)$ and $B\in\N$, the augmented version $G^B$ has vertex set $V^B \defeq\crl*{\pp{v,b}: v\in V, b=0,1,\ldots,B}\cup\crl*{v^-:v\in V}$, the edge set $E^B$ is\\ $\crl*{\pp{v,b}\pp{w,x} : vw\in E, x=b-c_{vw}, x\geq 0}\cup\crl*{\pp{v,b}v^-: v\in V, 0\leq b\leq B}$.
The length function in $G^B$ is $\ell(\pp{v,b},v^-) \defeq \frac{1}{b+1}$ and $\ell(\pp{v,b},\pp{w,x}) \defeq \ell(vv')$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\input{TexImg/augmented.tex}
\caption{Example of a graph augmentation: The original graph $G$ has all paths of unit length, and costs as labelled on the edges. In the augmented graph $G^B$, the labels represent the edge lengths (unlabelled edges have length 1). Note the additional edges from $(w,b)$ to the sink node $w^-$ (and similarly for $u$ and $v$). 
}

Paths in $G^B$ are mapped to paths in $G$ in the intuitive way, by removing the budget labels and sink nodes.
We call this mapping the \emph{projection} of a path.
%\begin{definition}
%Let $P$ be a path in $G^B$.
%If $P$ is of the form $\pp{v_1,b_1}\ldots\pp{v_k,b_k}$, then the projection of $P$, denoted $\bar P$, is the path $\bar P\defeq v_1v_2\ldots v_k$.
%Analogously, if $P$ is of the form $\pp{v_1,b_1}\ldots\pp{v_k,b_k}v_{k}^-$, then $\bar P\defeq v_1\ldots v_{k}$. 
%\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:shorteffic}
A shortest path from source $\pp{s,b}$ to sink node~$t^-$ projects to an efficient path in $G$ solving $\dist(s,t|b)$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $P$ be the shortest path from $\pp{s,b}$ to $t^-$, and $\bar P$ its projection.
To reach $t^-$, $P$ must pass through some $\pp{t,b'}$, $b'\geq 0$.
By construction, $P$ consumes $b-b'$ units of resource, hence it is feasible; moreover, $\bar P$ is the shortest among $(s,t)$-paths with cost $b-b'$.
Now assume, by way of contradiction, that $\bar P$ is not efficient.
As $\bar P$ is the shortest using $b-b'$ units of resource, there exists $P'$ such that $\ell(\bar P')\leq \ell(\bar P)$ and $c(\bar P')< c(\bar P)$.
It must be that $P'$ passes through $\pp{t,b''}$, with $b''>b'$.
We argue that, in this case, $P$ would not be a shortest path to $t^-$.
Indeed, 
\[
\ell(P')=\ell(\bar P')+\frac{1}{1+b''}
\leq \ell(\bar P) +\frac{1}{1+b''}
< \ell(\bar P) +\frac{1}{1+b'},
\]
where the last expression is exactly $\ell(P)$.
\end{proof}


Latter we give a construction that depends on LSHS for the system $\PE$, we call such object an efficient path hitting set (EPHS).
The next result allows us to relate EPHS of the original graph to LSHS in the augmented graph.
Note that in $G^B$ we are interested only in shortest paths ending in sink nodes (since these map to efficient paths). 
Let $\PB$ be the path system comprising all shortest paths in $G^B$ ending in a sink node.
A hitting set for $\PE$ can be used to obtain a hitting set for $\PB$, but, since the augmented graph has more information, the sparsity increases.
 
\begin{proposition}\label[proposition]{prop:lshsaug}
Given a  $(\hc,r)$-EPHS for the path system $\PE$, in polynomial time we can construct a $(\hc B,r)$-LSHS for $\PB$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Given $C$, an $(\hc,r)$-EPHS for $\PE$, define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hitset}
C^B\defeq \{\pp{v,b}: v\in C, v \text{ hits }\bar P\in\PB_r, c(\bar P)=b\leq B \}.
\end{equation}
We prove that $C^B$ hits $\PB_r$ and is locally sparse.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:shorteffic}, we know that shortest paths are efficient, hence $C^B$ hits all the desired paths.
Finally, we prove local sparsity.
Take any node $\pp{s,b}$ and observe that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:local_sparsity}
\Bf_{2r}(\pp{s,b}) = \{\pp{t,x}: \exists P\in\Pst, \ell(P)\leq 2r, c(P)=b-x\} 
\subseteq \{\pp{t,x}: t\in \Bf_{2r}(s), x\leq b\} . 
\end{equation}
We know that $\card{\Bf_{2r}(s)\cap C}\leq \hc$, therefore $\card{\Bf_{2r}(\pp{s,b})\cap C^B}\leq\hc b\leq \hc B$.
A similar argument shows the sparsity for the reverse ball.
\end{proof}

The proof above shows a stronger result:
In \cref{eq:local_sparsity} we see that the sparsity around the node $\pp{u,b}$ is $\hc b$.
This is key for our subsequent query time guarantees.

Surprisingly, in this case we can also relate the HDs of the path systems $\PE$ and $\PB$.
Note that this does not follow from \cref{prop:lshsaug}, since the HD is a stronger notion than existence of locally-sparse hitting sets.
\begin{proposition}\label[proposition]{prop:HDaugmented}
If the HD of the system $\PE$ is $h_c$, then the HD of the system $\PB$ is $Bh_c$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Fix $r>0$ and $\pp{v,b}\in V^B$ .
Let $H_{v,r}\subseteq V$ be the set hitting $S_r(v,\PE)$ and define $H\defeq H_{v,r}\times\{0,1,\ldots,B\}$.
We show that $H$ hits $\Sf_r(\pp{v,b},\PB)$.

Take $P\in\Sf_r(\pp{v,b},\PB)$.
Since $\dist(\pp{v,b},P)\leq 2r$, it holds $\dist(v,\bar P)\leq 2r$, hence $\bar P\in \Sf_r(v,\PE)$.
Finally, $H_{v,r}$ hits $\bar P$, thus $H$ hits $P$.
A similar argument shows that $H$ hits $\Sb_r(\pp{v,b},\PB)$.
\end{proof}
