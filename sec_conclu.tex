We introduced a new network primitive, the Constrained Highway Dimension, and used it to parametrize the storage and running time of data structures that support fast CSP queries.
We derived conditions under which the performance of our algorithms are competitive versus the corresponding SP algorithms, both in the worst-case and average-case settings.
On the practical side, we validated our findings by developing algorithms that performed four orders of magnitude better on real-world networks, compared to standard techniques.
Our work is a first step in bridging the gap between SP and CSP algorithms, but we believe our findings are promising for real-world applications.
