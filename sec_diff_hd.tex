The original definition of HD was given by \cite{highway2010}, but this is not the one we extend, but rather we work from the definition of~\cite{highway2013}.
The latter is the same as our notion except that $(i)$ we consider a less restrictive definition of path neighborhoods, that is appropriate for our needs, and $(ii)$ we generalize the notion to directed graphs and general path systems.
For $\PS$, a consequence of considering less-restrictive path-neighborhoods is that the highway dimension returned by our definition is smaller than that of \cite{highway2013}.
In particular, unlike \cite{highway2013}, the HD of $G$ as per our definition is not an upper bound to the maximum degree $\Delta$ or the doubling dimension $\alpha$.

With respect to our average HD in \cref{sec:avg_hd}, we note the following.
\begin{remark}
The algorithm in \cref{theo:preproc_avg} makes one call to the VC-dimension solver for each $C_i$.
On the other hand, the algorithm in \cite{highway2013} calls up to $n$ times the solver for each $C_i$.
Finally, there is an extra $\log n$ factor in the approximation guarantee, but now the value of $h$ can be much smaller.
\end{remark}

We now discuss how our results extend to the definition in \cite{highway2013}, which we refer to as strong-HD.
The strong-HD defines a path $P$ to be $r$-significant if, by adding at most one hop at each end, we get a shortest path $P'$ longer than $r$.
The path $P'$ is called an $r$-witness for $P$.
Intuitively, a path is significant if it represents a long path.
Observe that, if $P\in\PS$ is such that $\ell(P)>r$, then $P$ is $r$-significant by definition.
We remark also that a path can have many $r$-witnesses.

Finally, the path neighborhood must also be strengthened.
The path $P\in\PS$ belongs to $\Sf_r(v)$ if, $P$ has some $r$-witness $P'$ such that $\dist(v,P')\leq 2r$.
The reverse neighborhood $\Sb_r(v)$ is defined analogously.
With this modified versions of $r$-significant and neighborhood, the notions of LSHS and HD are the same as our previous definitions.

Under the strong-HD, we have  $\Delta\leq h$ and $\alpha\leq h+1$.
Additionally, this definition allows proving results for CH.
Finally, we show that even for the strong-HD, CHD and HD can still be off by a factor of $n$.

\begin{proposition}\label[proposition]{prop:treelike}
For any $h$, we can construct a family of networks such that the sparsity of LSHS is $h$ and that of EPHS is arbitrarily worse than $h$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First, we construct an example where the sparsity grows from $h$ to $h^2$.
Consider an $h$-ary tree rooted at $u$ with three levels, i.e., with $1+h+h^2$ nodes.
Now add a node $v$ with $h$ children as in Figure~\ref{fig:treelike}. 
The grandchildren of $v$ are the same as the grandchildren of $u$.

All the edges are bidirectional and have unit cost.
The lengths are as follows: $ux_i$ and $vy_i$ (dashed in Figure~\ref{fig:treelike}) are zero; $uv$ and from $y_i$ to the leafs is one; from $x_i$ to the leafs is three.
It is easy to see that the sparsity of a LSHS is $h+1$.

On the other hand, every leaf $w$ is a $2$-efficient path.
Indeed, it can be extended to $x_iw$ that is the shortest path from $x_i$ to $w$ with constraint 1.
All the leafs are in the ball $B_4(u)$, so the sparsity is at least $h^2$.

\end{figure}

The general case works in the same fashion.
We make the sparsity grow to $h^k$ by creating two complete, $k$-level, $h$-ary trees $T$ and $T'$.
Connect the root of $T$ to the root of $T'$ and the leafs of both trees are shared.
Observe that the number of nodes is 
\begin{align*}
n &=[\text{$k$-level $h$-ary tree}] + [\text{$(k-1)$-level $h$-ary tree}]\\
&= ({h^{k+1}-1})/({h-1}) + ({h^k-1})/({h-1}),
\end{align*}
therefore the sparsity is $\Theta(n)$, the worst possible.
\end{proof}
