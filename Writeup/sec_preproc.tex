\anote{maybe not a subsection of CSP? it applies to any path system (e.g. shortest paths)}
It was shown in \cite{highway2013} that the set system of shortest paths has VC-dimension of $2$.
More formally, paths $v_1v_2\ldots v_k$ are mapped to sets $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$ and this new set system has small VC-dimension.
Observe that, if $G$ is undirected, then each subset represents exactly two paths, namely the $(s,t)$-path and the $(t,s)$-path.
Therefore, a hitting set for the set system corresponds to a hitting set for $\calP$.

Recall that we assume uniqueness of shortest paths.
It is easy to see that the VC-dimension of the previous set system is 2.
Indeed, a path $abc$ is mapped to $\{a,b,c\}$ and the element $\{a,c\}$ would never form a part of the system; the shortest path between $a$ and $c$ must pass through $b$, therefore $\{a,b,c\}$ cannot be shattered.

In directed graphs the same relation can still be made, but the VC-dimension would not be small.
For example, the directed graph can contain the shortest paths $abc$ and $ca$, mapping to sets $\{a,b,c\}$ and $\{c,a\}$, breaking the previous argument.

To overcome this, we now think of paths as sequences of edges.
The ground set for the set system is $E$, instead of $V$ and a path $e_1e_2\ldots e_k$ is mapped to $\{e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_k\}$.
Note that each $\{e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_k\}$ corresponds uniquely to one path.
Recall that in a system $\calQ$ the cycles are not allowed.
We denote $\pi(Q)$ the set of edges in a path $Q$.

\begin{proposition}
Given a system $\calQ$, the corresponding set system $(E,\{\pi(Q):Q\in\calQ\})$ has VC-dimension 2.
\end{proposition}

We now stablish how to obtain polynomial time preprocessing.
Specifically, the algorithms we use are based on the existence of $(h,2^i)$-LSHS.
Assuming a system has HD $h$, we can obtain an approximation of these set, where the sparsity increases by the maximum degree $\Delta$.
The proof can be found in Section~\ref{sec:proofs}.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:poly_lshs}
If a system $\calQ$ has HD $h$, for some $h'=\Or(h\Delta\log(h\Delta))$ there exists a polynomial time algorithm to obtain a $(h',r)$-LSHS.	
\end{proposition}
