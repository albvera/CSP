We now turn to the problem of constructing hub-labels for constrained shortest-paths queries and, in particular, for computing efficient paths in $G$. 
Recall we are interested in settings where edges contain both lengths and costs, and wherein all edge-costs are non-negative integers.
Now, we want to develop a data-structure that supports fast queries for \emph{efficient paths}. 

In Section \ref{ssec:hldef} we discussed that, if a graph $G$ has HD $\leq h$, we can simultaneously bound, as functions of $h$, the preprocessing time, storage requirements and query time for constructing HL.
This suggests that for the construction of provably efficient HL for the CSP problem, one needs to define an analogous property for the set of \emph{efficient paths}.
\begin{definition}
\textbf{(Constrained Highway Dimension)}\\ The constrained highway dimension (CHD) of $(G,\ell,c)$, denoted $h_c$, is the HD of the efficient-path system $\PE$.
\end{definition}
Note that every shortest path is efficient, thus $h_c\geq h$, where $h$ is the HD of $G$ under shortest paths.

We now have two main issues with this definition: first, it is unclear how this can be used to get hub labels, and second, it is unclear how the corresponding hub labels compare with those for shortest-path computations. To address this, we first convert efficient paths in $G$ to shortest paths in a larger \emph{augmented graph}. In Section \ref{ssec:hlcsp}, we use this to construct hub labels for CSP queries whose storage and query complexity can be bounded as $Bh_c$ (which can be strengthened further to $g(b)h_c$, where $g(b)$ is measure of the size of the Pareto frontier; cf. Section~\ref{sec:frontier}.). Finally, in Section \ref{ssec:hdvschd}, we show that the hub labels for CSP queries can in fact be related to the hub labels for SP queries under an additional natural condition on the efficient paths.
