We now turn to the problem of constructing hub-labels for finding constrained shortest-paths (and more particularly, for computing efficient paths) in $G$.

In Section \ref{ssec:hldef}, we discuss how if a graph $G$ has HD $\leq h$, then we can simultaneously bound the preprocessing time, storage requirements and query time of a certain algorithm for constructing hub-label as functions of $h$.
This suggests that for the construction of provably efficient HL for the CSP problem, one needs to define an analogous property for the set of \emph{efficient paths}.
To this end, we have
\begin{definition}
\textbf{(Constrained Highway Dimension)} The constrained highway dimension (CHD) of $(G,\ell,c)$, denoted $h_c$, is the HD of the efficient-path system $\PE$.
\end{definition}
Note that every shortest path is efficient, and thus $h_c\geq h$ (where $h$ is the HD of $G$ under shortest paths).


We now have two main issues with this definition: First, it is unclear how this can be used to get hub labels, and second, it is unclear how the corresponding hub labels compare with those for shortest-path computations.
