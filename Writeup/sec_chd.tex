We now turn to the problem of constructing hub-labels for computing efficient paths in $G$.

We have established that small HD explains the remarkable performance of HL.
In the same spirit, we introduce a notion that allows for the construction of provably efficient HL for the CSP problem.
The system of interest will be that of efficient paths, in contrast to shortest paths.


The definition of Constrained Highway Dimension (CHD) is the natural object when we take the system of efficient paths.
Note that every shortest path is efficient, thus the CHD will always be bigger than the HD of a network.

\begin{definition}
The CHD of $(G,\ell,c)$, denoted $h_c$, is the HD of the system $\PE$.
\end{definition}
