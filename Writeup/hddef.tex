We now define the notions of hitting sets for path systems, and the highway dimension (HD), which we use to parametrize the performance of our algorithms. The highway dimension was introduced by Abraham et al.~\cite{highway2010,highway2013} for undirected graphs and the shortest-path set system. Our presentation closely follows these works; however, for our purposes, we need to extend the definitions to directed graphs and general path systems. \sbnote{Downward closure?}

We define a \emph{path system} $\calQ$ as any collection of paths. Given a set $C\subseteq V$ and a path $Q$, we say that $C$ \emph{hits} $Q$ if some node in $Q$ belongs to $C$. Moreover, we say that $C$ is a \emph{hitting set for a path system} $\calQ$ if it hits every $Q\in\calQ$.


Hitting sets are useful for compressing path systems. In particular, though a hitting set may be large, the extent to which a path system can be compressed depends on the \emph{local sparsity} of a hitting set with respect to \emph{significant paths} of $\calQ$. 
Following \cite{highway2013}, for any $r>0$, we say a path $Q$ is $r$-significant $\ell(Q)>r$. For a given path-system $\calQ$, we denote $\calQ_r$ as the set of all $r$-significant paths in $\calQ$.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:lshs}
\textbf{(Locally-Sparse Hitting Sets)} Given a path system $\calQ$ and $r>0$, an $(h,r)$ locally-sparse hitting set (or $(h,r)$-LSHS) is a set $C\subseteq V$ with two properties: 
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item Hitting: $C$ is a hitting set for $\calQ_r$.
\item Local sparsity: for every $v\in V$, $\abs*{B_{2r}(v)\cap C}\leq h$.
%$\card{\Bb_{2r}(v)\cap C}\leq h$ and $\card{\Bf_{2r}(v)\cap C}\leq h$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


The existence of $(h,r)$-LSHS enables the compression of path-system $\calQ$ via the construction of \emph{hub labels} (cf. Section~\ref{ssec:hldef}). Moreover, a natural greedy algorithm gives hitting sets with local-sparsity $h\log n$ in polynomial time. To find hitting sets which are independent of $n$,~Abraham et al.~\cite{highway2013} introduced the notion of the \emph{highway dimension}. We first need two additional definitions:
for $v\in V, r>0$, we define the \emph{forward and reverse path-neighborhoods} with respect to path-system $\calQ$ as 
\begin{align*}
S_r^+(v,\calQ) &\defeq\crl*{Q\in\calQ_r: \dist(v,Q)\leq 2r}, \\  
S_r^-(v,\calQ) &\defeq\crl*{Q\in\calQ_r: \dist(Q,v)\leq 2r},
\end{align*}
and as before, we have $S_r(v,\calQ) = S_r^+(v,\calQ)\cup S_r^-(v,\calQ)$. Now we can define the highway dimension (HD) of $G$. Essentially, the HD re-orders the sequence of qualifiers in the definition of $(h,r)$-LSHS: it requires the existence of a small hitting set for each individual neighborhood, rather than a single hitting set which is locally sparse. 
\begin{definition}
\label{def:hddef}
\textbf{(Highway Dimension)}
A path-system $\calQ$ has HD $h$ if, for every $r>0$, and for every $v\in V$, there exist sets $H_{v,r}\subseteq V$ such that $\card{H_{v,r}}\leq h$ and $H_{v,r}$ is a hitting set for $S_r^+(v,\calQ)\cup S_r^-(v,\calQ)$.
\end{definition}
The HD was defined in \cite{highway2013} for undirected graphs and the shortest-path system $\calP$. 
The above definition is the natural analog for directed graphs and general set systems (as shorthand, we refer to the HD of $(G,\ell)$ as that of the shortest-path system $\calP$). 
To see that $HD\leq h$ is a more stringent requirement than the existence of an $(h,r)$-LSHS $C$, note that $C\cap B_{2r}(v)$ need not hit all the paths in $S_r(v,\calQ)$. 
However, if $G$ has $HD\leq h$, then this guarantees the existence of a $(h,r)$-LSHS.
\begin{proposition}
If the path system $\calQ$ has HD $h$, then, $\forall\,r>0$, there exists an $(h,r)$-LSHS.
\end{proposition}
This follows directly from Theorem 4.2 in \cite{highway2013}, which showed it for the shortest-path system.


Finally, we note that for pedagogical reasons, Definition~\ref{def:hddef} differs slightly from \cite{highway2013}; in particular, we consider a less restrictive definition of path neighborhoods (albeit for general path systems) that is appropriate for our needs. Consequently the highway dimension as returned by our definition is smaller than that of \cite{highway2013}~\footnote{In particular, unlike \cite{highway2013}, the HD of $G$ as per our definition is not an upper bound to the maximum degree $\Delta$ or the doubling dimension $\alpha$.}.
We discuss the relation between the two definitions in detail in Appendix \ref{app:generalhd}.
