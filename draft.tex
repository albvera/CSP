\section{Generalization to general constraint}

We have dealt with cost constraints so far, but our approach can be applied to more general settings.
Consider when edges have capacity instead of cost and we want the shortest path given a minimum capacity.
Another example is when edges have labels, e.g. if it is a carpool lane or not, if it is a main street, etc.
In the last example, we would like a shortest path avoiding certain labels, e.g. avoiding carpool lanes if the user travels alone.
We need to abstract the problem to obtain the connection between all these scenarios.

Given a path system $\calQ$, we want to find the shortest path among those in $\calQ$.
We assume that queries are in the form $(s,t,\calQ')$, where $s,t\in V$ and $\calQ'\subseteq\calQ$.
For example, the CSP has $\calQ=\PE$ and $\calQ'$ is the set of efficient paths with cost at most $b$.
The problem to solve is then $\min \ell(P) \text{ s.t. } P\in\Pst\cap\calQ'$ for an input $(s,t,\calQ')$.
We do not ask to solve for any input $\calQ'\subseteq \calQ$, but for \emph{admissible inputs}, which are defined by the designer.
For example, admissible inputs for the CSP are ``paths with cost at most $b$'', but ``paths with cost between $b_1$ and $b_2$'' are not.  

\begin{definition}[Integer Embedded Constraints]
Let $\calQ$ be any path system.
If there is a function $\psi:\calQ\to\Z^d$ such that, for any admissible input $\calQ'\subseteq \calQ$, $\exists b\in \Z^d$ with the property $P\in \calQ'\Leftrightarrow \psi(P)\leq b$, then we say that $\psi$ is an integer embedding of the problem.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
The following are integer embedded constraints \anote{the definition of efficient depends on the problem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item CSP, with $\calQ=\crl{P\in \PE: c(P)\leq B}$ for a given $B$. 
The function is $\psi(P)=c(P)$ and $b$ is the natural choice.
\item Capacity constraints, with $\calQ=\crl{P\in \PE: \text{cap}(P)\leq B}$ for a given $B$.
The function is $\psi(P)=\min_{e\in P}\text{cap}(P)$ and $b$ is the minimum capacity.
\item Label constraints with $\calQ=\crl{P\in \PE: \text{labels}(P) \in B}$ for a given $B\subseteq 2^{\text{Labels}}$.
In this case the dimension is $\abs{\crl{l:l\text{ is in an element of }B}}$ and $\psi(P)_l = \In{P \text{ has label }l}$.
\item CSP with pairwise correlated costs. In this case the dimension is two \anote{ to do }
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


\begin{proposition}
If $\calQ$ has HD $h$ and has an integer embedding $\psi:\calQ\to\Z^d$, let $M=\max_i\max\crl{\psi(P)_i:P \text{ is admissible}}$.
Then, we can construct HL to answer queries in time $\Or(bh\log D)$.
The total space requirement is $\Or(nM\cdot Mh\log D)$.
\end{proposition}

\section{Examples}

An important notion is that, if efficient paths oscillate too much between free and tolled edges, then it is very unlikely to observe partial witnesses.
In Figure~\ref{fig:nosubpath} we present a graph with no $\frac{1}{2}$-partial witness.
Every edge has unit length, dash edges have zero cost and solid edges have unit cost.
The path $uvwx$ is efficient, but every subpath that is shortest has length one.
The example can be generalized by placing the graph side by side many times.
This shows that, for any constant $k$ we can find examples with no $\frac{1}{k}$-partial witnesses.
